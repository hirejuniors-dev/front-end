# Hire Juniors

Looking for the first job in tech is not easy. Although there are a lot of openings out there is no central place where these postings are listed, especially for junior roles and internships. [hirejuniors.dev](https://hirejuniors.dev) is a website that aims to list all these opportunities for someone who is going to start their journey in tech. [hirejuniors.dev](https://hirejuniors.dev) aims to be a community-driven project. If you come across any job posting for a junior role or for an internship please fill-out the Typeform to get it listed.

The amount of content out there can overwhelm people who are just starting their journey. [hirejuniors.dev](https://hirejuniors.dev) aims to list all the useful resources that can help them. We will list all the useful resources that you found useful, and that you would recommend someone. If there are resources that benefited you please share them with the community.

Let us take a step to help and welcome junior developers on this amazing journey.
